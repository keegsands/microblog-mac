# Micro.blog for Mac

https://help.micro.blog/t/micro-blog-for-mac/45

About the open source project... We may not integrate pull requests into the released version of the app. If you use the code in another project, please don't use the name Micro.blog unless it is obviously distinct from the product name. For example: "Your App for Micro.blog" is fine, but "Micro.blog 3.0" is not.

You may notice references to Snippets in the source code. That was an early code name for the project. You may also notice mentions of Riverfold Software (or RF). That was the former home of an early Micro.blog prototype before it was its own thing.
